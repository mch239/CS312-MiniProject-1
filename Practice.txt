Did not install any dependencies aside from express, ejs, nodemon. 
    - Just installed the body-parser dependency 
    - Installed bootstrap and working on creating seperate directories for 
    "views", "editing", "deleting" and "styling". 
    - Renamed "index.js" to "server.js" to cause less confusion. 
Trying again......3rd time starting over...
